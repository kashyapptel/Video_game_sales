We are going to remove unnecessary data from the table and perform some following transformations required for our analysis.
1) Rounding global_sales to 0 decimal points
2)Include reading having critic score greater than 0
3)Consider only 3 columns from original data set: Genre, Global sales and Critic_score.


Query for loading the table in to Hadoop.
